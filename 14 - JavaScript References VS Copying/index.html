    <h3>Difference between Reference VS Copy is fundementally important in JS, especially with nested data.</h3>

        // start with strings, numbers and booleans
        // Note: When you change the original variable, it will not change the second variable
        let age = 100;
        let age2 = age;
        console.log(age, age2); // 100 100
        age = 200;
        console.log(age, age2); // 200 100

        let name = "Phil";
        let name2 = name;
        console.log(name, name2); // Phil Phil
        name = "PhilCurtis"
        console.log(name, name2); // PhilCurtis Phil
        // If you change the original variable, notice it will not change the second variable


        // Let's say we have an array
        let players = ['player01', 'player02', 'player03', 'player04'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.
        const team = players;
        console.log("players = ", players); // Results: players =  (4) ["player01", "player02", "player03", "player04"]
        console.log("team = ", team); // Results: team =  (4) ["player01", "player02", "player03", "player04"]

        // You might think we can just do something like this as was done above:
        console.log("Now add this line of code: team[3] = 'player04b' and see what happens to the two variables");
        team[3] = "player04b"

        // however what happens when we update that array?
        console.log("players = ", players); // Results: players =  (4) ["player01", "player02", "player03", "player04b"]
        console.log("team = ", team); // Results: team =  (4) ["player01", "player02", "player03", "player04b"]
        // now here is the problem!
        console.log("The original array has been edited too!  Why? Because it is an array reference, not an array copy so both point to the same array.");
        // Note: If you change the array in the second variable, notice it will change the original array from the first variable, it will always reference back to the array.

        // So, how do we fix this?  Note: This is how to create a copy of an Array
        // Note: Instead of making a reference to the array, make a copy of the array.
        // There are many ways to copy an array.
        players = ['player01', 'player02', 'player03', 'player04'];

        // 1) one way
        const team2 = players.slice(); // Slice with nothing passed in will make a copy the array
        console.log("players.slice() (A new array-identical to the first) = ", players.slice());
        console.log("players.slice(2,3) (normal use of slice) = ", players.slice(2, 3)); // normal use of slice
        team2[0] = 'player01b-slice()'
        console.log("team2 = ", team2);
        console.log("players = ", players);

        // 2) 2nd way; create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players); // take a blank array and concatinate in the existing array
        team3[1] = 'player02b-concat'
        console.log("team3 = ", team3);
        console.log("players = ", players);

        // 3) 3rd way; use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players]; // spread will take every item out of the iterable (array), and put it into the container (a new array)
        team4[2] = 'player03b-ES6-Spread Method'
        console.log("team4 = ", team4);
        console.log("players = ", players);


        // 4) 4th way; 
        const team5 = Array.from(players) // Wes' favorite method
        team5[3] = 'player04c-.from'
        console.log("team5 = ", team5);
        console.log("players = ", players);

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // 5:55
        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'StephTresidder',
            age: 32
        };

        // and think we make a copy:
        const person02 = person;
        person.age = 99;
        console.log('person =', person); // Results: Object {name: "StephTresidder", age: 99}
        console.log('person02 =', person02); // Results: Object {name: "StephTresidder", age: 99}
        console.log('notice with person and person02, both have been changed');

        // how do we take a copy of an object instead? (06:20)
        // Object.assign() is how
        // start with a blank object
        // pass it the object needed to copy all the properties from
        // pass in the new properties to overwrite
        // Put all this inside it's own variable
        const person03 = Object.assign({}, person, { // Note: captial 'O' in Object (lower case = error)
            number: 99,
            age: 12
        });
        console.log("person03 = ", person03);
        console.log('person =', person);

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        // const person04 = {...person}; // not yet in JavaScript

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
