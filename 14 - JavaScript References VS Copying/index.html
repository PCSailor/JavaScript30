    <h1>Difference between Reference VS Copy is fundementally important in JS, especially with nested data.</h1>
    <script>
        // start with strings, numbers and booleans
        let age = 100;
        let age2 = age;
        console.log(age, age2); // 100 100
        age = 200;
        console.log(age, age2); // 200 100

        let name = "Phil";
        let name2 = name;
        console.log(name, name2); // Phil Phil
        name = "PhilCurtis"
        console.log(name, name2); // PhilCurtis Phil
        // If you change the original variable, notice it will not change the second variable

        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['player01', 'player02', 'player03', 'player04'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.
        const team = players;
        console.log("players = ", players, "team = ", team); // players =  (4) ["player01", "player02", "player03", "player04"] team =  (4) ["player01", "player02", "player03", "player04"]

        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        team[3] = "player04b"

        // however what happens when we update that array?
        console.log("players = ", players, "team = ", team); // players =  (4) ["player01", "player02", "player03", "player04b"] team =  (4) ["player01", "player02", "player03", "player04b"]

        // now here is the problem!  oh no - we have edited the original array too!  Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // If you change the array in the second variable, notice it will change the original array from the first variable, it will always reference back to the array.

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        const team2 = players.slice(); // Slice with nothing passed in will copy the array

        // one way

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in

        // or use the new ES6 Spread

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // 5:55
        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects

        // and think we make a copy:

        // how do we take a copy instead?

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
